#Coursera Project Assignment

#Week 4 - Getting and Cleaning Data
#Version 1.0

The project's main goal is to prepare tidy data usable for later analysis. More specifically, the project aims to show one's ability in terms of collecting, working with and cleaning data.

The repository contains four items: 'runanalysis.R', 'README.md', 'CodeBook.md', and 'finaldatasummarized.txt'.

1. runanalysis.R

    This R script transforms and combines training and testing data representing those collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. To add, the script creates a summarized dataset which includes the mean of the non-identification columns--this, aggregated per type of test subject and type of activity done during obtaining the sample.

2. README.md

    This is the current file you are looking at. It contains a short background of the project assignment and the repository created in Github.

3. CodeBook.md

    This contains information on the data, variables and the transformation done to get and clean the data.

4. finaldatasummarized.txt

    This is the final data set created. It contains averaged values for each observation aggregated by the test subject and the type of activity done during sampling.
